        <h2>Beloved Vietnamese Dish</h2>
        <p>Vietnamese pho is all about the broth. In this authentic recipe, beef bones, fish sauce, star anise, and ginger simmer for at least 6 hours, creating a complex, aromatic broth that may not be quick, but it's certainly delicious. The flavorful broth is ladled over rice noodles and thinly sliced beef and topped with fresh garnishes.</p>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).</li>
            <li>Place beef bones on a baking sheet and roast in the preheated oven until browned, about 1 hour.</li>
            <li>Place onion halves on a second baking sheet and roast on another rack until blackened and soft, about 45 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer beef bones and onion halves to a large stockpot. Add ginger, salt, star anise, fish sauce, and 4 quarts water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low and simmer for 6 to 10 hours. Strain the broth into a saucepan and set aside.</li>
            <li>Place rice noodles in a large bowl filled with room temperature water. Let soak for 1 hour. Drain.</li>
            <li>When noodles have soaked for 1 hour, heat up the reserved broth by bringing it to a simmer.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook the noodles in the boiling water for 1 minute. Drain.</li>
            <li>Divide noodles among 4 serving bowls; top with sirloin, cilantro, and green onion. Ladle hot broth over the top. Stir and let sit until beef is partially cooked and no longer pink, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
            <li>Serve with bean sprouts, Thai basil, lime wedges, hoisin sauce, and chile-garlic sauce on the side.</li>
